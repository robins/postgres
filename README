PsqlForks
=========

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system, along with modifications required for 
PsqlForks.

PsqlForks is a psql variant that tries to accommodate as many 
PostgrSQL variants (or software that speak the PostgreSQL protocol 
to an extent).

The current status of support for different PostgreSQL derived databases
can be seen here:

https://github.com/robins/postgres/blob/forks/src/bin/psql/README.md

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file LICENSE.txt.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
distribution; it can be read as described in the installation
instructions.

The latest version of this software may be obtained at
https://github.com/robins/postgres/tree/forks . For more information look 
at the web site located at http://www.thatguyfromdelhi.com/search/label/psql .
